In this file I give an overview of the content of the folder "Simulazione Numerica". 
In the folder it has been created a folder for each exercise.
For each exercises I've created a notebook describing the exercises and the results called "SambrunaA_LSN_Exercises_n.ipynb" where n is the number of exercise. 

Some exercises have been divided into sub-exercises and for each I've created a subfolder deditated. 

	- Esercitazione 1: 
		-Esercise 1.1: Exercise on the block mean
		-Exercise 1.2: Exercise on random generator with different distributions (Uniform, Cauchy, Gaussian, Exponential)
		-Exercise 1.3: Simultion of the Buffon Experiment to calculate the value of pi
	- Esercitazione 2:   
		-Exercise_2.1: Monte Carlo Integration tecniques
		-Exercise_2.2: Random Walk simuation
	- Esercitazione 3: Simulation in Finance - Simulation of the Vanilla Option
	- Esercitazione 4: Molecolar Dynamics
	- Esercitazione 6: Ising Model 1D simulation
	- Esercitazione 7: Monte Carlo Simulation - Metropolis Algorithm
		-Exercise_7.1_2: Preliminary Outputs
		-Exercise_2.3_4: Simulation
	- Esercitazione 8: Search of the Ground State of a quantum system 
	- Esercitazione 9: The Problem of the Travelling Saleman - Genetics Algoritm
	- Esercitazione 10: The Problem of the Travelling Saleman - Genetics Algoritm + MPI - Parallel Program
	- Esercitazione 11: Introduction to machine learning: creation of 3 examples of NN
	- Esercitazione 12: Creation of a DNN and a CNN in order to recognize handwritten digits
	 
For each folder I wrote a "README.md" file where I describe how to compile and run the code

Moreover, each folder will contain the following files: 
- Primes
- primes32001.in
- seed.in 
- seed.out
needed to make the random generator works. 
The Random Class definition and implementation is contained in 
- random.cpp
- random.h
