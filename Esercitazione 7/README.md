# Exercise 7
Exercise 7 is divided into two sub exercises:
- Exercise_7.1_7.2: 
The first part of the exercise consist of simply adding the tail correction for pressure and potential energy to the given code. 
In the second part of the exercise a simulation is performed and other preliminary estimations are made. 

- Exercise_7.3_7.4:
Given the previous observations, the simulation of the system is performed and we calculate the termodynamical quantities.
